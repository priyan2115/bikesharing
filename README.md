# Overview Of Project

  **In this challenge in the first deliverable we use Pandas for creating a DataFrame from .csv file and then we converted the "tripduration" column's datatype from "Int64" to "datetime" as well as create new column name "tripduration_original" in this column we store the original tripduration column data and in the "tripduration" column we stored the new changed datatype data.
  After changing the datatype we converted DataFrame in to the csv file called "citibike_tripdata.csv" and from that csv file we create a set of visualization.**

  **Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, weâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two we created in this module for your final presentation and analysis.**

# Bikesharing
Tableau 
# Overview Of Project

  **In this challenge in the first deliverable we use Pandas for creating a DataFrame from .csv file and then we converted the "tripduration" column's datatype from "Int64" to "datetime" as well as create new column name "tripduration_original" in this column we store the original tripduration column data and in the "tripduration" column we stored the new changed datatype data.
  After changing the datatype we converted DataFrame in to the csv file called "citibike_tripdata.csv" and from that csv file we create a set of visualization.**
  
  
  **Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, we’ll add these new visualizations to the two we created in this module for your final presentation and analysis.**

# Results
* # Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
### Create the Checkout Times for Users Viz
**In this visualization, you’ll graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.
Our final results should look similar to the following image:**

![Checkout_Times_for_Users](Checkout_Times_for_Users.png)
### Create the Checkout Times by Gender Viz
**In this visualization, you’ll graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.
 Our final results should look similar to the following image:**

![Checkout_Times_by_Gender](Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)

### Create the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz
**In this visualization, we’ll graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.
Our final results should look similar to the following image:**

![Trips_by_Weekday_for_Each_Hour](Trips_by_Weekday_for_Each_Hour.png)

### Create the Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Viz
**This visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap.
Result should look like following Image:**

![Trips_by_Gender_(Weekday per Hour)](Trips_by_Gender_(Weekday per Hour).png)

### Create the User Trips by Gender by Weekday Viz
**In this visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap.
Result should looks like the following Image:**

![Checkout_Times_by_Gender](Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)
